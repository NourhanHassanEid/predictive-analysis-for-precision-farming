# Predictive-analysis-for-Precision-Farming
This repository contains all the work had been done in **ONE LAB Egypt** Descriptive analysis on PA using ML internship.
The general scope of the proposed project lies in the field of agricultural development by using green electromagnetic-based techniques. In particular, the project focuses on the early prediction and control of the harmful green field living organisms by using **Machine Learning** models that capable to predict the numbers and conditions of these organisms then control the quasi-stationary magnetic fields. In this project, we target
