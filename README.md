# Predictive-analysis-for-Precision-Farming
This repository contains all the work had been done in ONE LAB Egypt Descriptive analysis on PA using ML internship.The general scope of the proposed project lies in the field of agricultural development by using green electromagnetic-based techniques. In particular, the project focuses on the early prediction and control of the harmful green field living organisms by using **Machine Learning** models that capable to predict the numbers and conditions of these organisms then control the quasi-stationary magnetic fields. In this project, we target
